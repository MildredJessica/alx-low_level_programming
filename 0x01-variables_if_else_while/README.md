**Assign a random number to the variable n**
**Assign a random number to the variable n. The output of the program should be: he string Last digit of, followed by,n, followed by n, followed by if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5,
if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0**
